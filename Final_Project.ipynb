    "I recently read an article about 'The 2 Most Powerful Forces in Markets' (see Link below) which were defined as Momentum and Mean Reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I thought I'd try a combination strategy that invests both in stocks that seem to be 'on a run' and outperforming their historical averages (i.e. the 'momentum' stocks) and in those that seem to be underperforming lately and primed for a comeback (i.e. the 'mean reversion' stocks).  I've set up a bunch of variables that allow for future flexibility.  For example, you can change this program to look at the most recent annual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly returns and compare those to the corresponding historical average annual/quarterly/monthly/weekly returns to determine the momentum and mean reversion stocks.  Of course, using our backtesting function we developed, I've set it up to avoid hindsight bias and only trade on actionable (not-forward looking) data.  You can also vary the number of momentum and mean reversion stocks you want to invest in separately. Per usual, I've set some liquidity limits based on trading volume and price limits as well.  In class we used 1 or 2 dollars for price and around 100,000 dollars trading volume for our limits, but I found that to be particularly unsuccessful as I ran through interations of this strategy (I think because of the massive crashes of penny stocks).  So, I decided to go with limits of 20 dollars (price) and 1M dollars (volume)...this seems to have performed quite well, but was a random selection - there's certainly some possibilty to adjust these and perhaps impove the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I was worried about in this strategy was getting caught up in \"buying the hype\" on the momentum side, leaving me susceptible to a 'pump and dump' or any other mania driven hype.  Additionally, I was worried about mean reversion stocks that recently have wildly underperformed their historical returns, suggesting that maybe something was incredibly and obviously wrong, that an automoated strategy inherently cannot recognize.  To (hopefully) account for that, when I select the most over- and under-performing stocks each period, this strategy intentionally avoids the stocks that are trading furthest from their averages by way of the tail() function in pandas.  For this submission, I cut off the 5 best performers and 10 worst performers.  Again, this was more or less decided randomly, and could certainly be optmized, but the result seems to be pretty acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to note that my backtest strategy starts in 2009, since the most recent PRICE data from my .csv files starts at 2009-04-15 and I didn't want to re-run the download functions to look back further.  But, since we've seen a boom (most of the last 10+ years) and a bust (COVID), hopefully, the data is fairly representative of long term performance.  If not, it would be rather easy to modify and look back futher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, someday I would like to evaluate this strategy to include trading on margin as well.  However, after evaluating the performance of my base set of assumptions (number of momentum/mean reversion stocks as well as how many to cut off, minimum price and volume, monthy rebalancing, etc.), the results (which you'll see below), suggested that the strategy was more volatile with a lower Sharpe Ratio (but with greater returns) than benchmarks and that maybe margin would be unwise.  Additionally, I'm not personally inclined to borrow on margin, as much as I want to, so I've held off for now.\n",

    "This strategy seems like it works!  At very least, for the time period considered, it 'beat' the market from a returns standpoint.  From a Risk Premium, Volatility, and Sharpe Ratio perspective, this strategy trailed the market.  That's not really that surprising, since it trades on stocks that are performing most divergently from their historical average (basically the definition of volatilty). Up until shortly after 2018, this strategy seemed to greatly outperform the SPY/VTI benchmarks.  I'm not sure exactly why 2018 seemed to be when this strategy \"came back to Earth\" or what it was in the early 2010's that resulted in the superior performance.  As mentioned, this strategy is inherently risky as it trades on recent bias (monthly, in this specific analysis) for over- and under-performing stocks.  This is akin to a \"timing the market\" strategy, which has been repeatedly been shown to underperform in the long-term. However, the results of this particular analysis are promising, but not indicitive of long-term success."

    "It seems that in high-growth, strong market conditions (last 10 years), this strategy will perform well.  Obviously, \"a rising tide that lifts all boats\" bodes well for both high momentum stocks (building on current success) and under-performing stocks (being lifted by general strong-market sentiment).  However, as can be seen from post-2018 until the COVID pandemic, this strategy tanked considerably relative to benchmark indices.  And then, post-COVID, the strategy has done exceedingly well.  Quite a roller-coaster!  It seems to provide some wisdom against the highly volatile, \"chasing earnings,\" or \"buy-the dip\" strategies, at least when things go South. I think there's some potential to fine-tune some of the variables in this strategy and optimizing, but, ultimately, I don't expect that I've found anything earth-shattering in my \"MOMENTUM + MEAN REVERSION COMBO STRATEGY.\"\n",
